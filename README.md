# rust-tidy

A wrapper library for [Html Tidy](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5) in rust.

The implementation provides access to a subset of html tidys api in a (hopefully) more rust friendly way.

Lib is in an early stage and work in progress.

Intermittant api docs can be browsed [here](https://terminalstatic.github.io/rust-tidy/tidy/index.html).

# rust-tidy

A wrapper library for [Html Tidy](https://github.com/htacg/tidy-html5) in rust.

The implementation provides access to a major but not complete part of html tidys api in a (hopefully) more rust friendly way.

Please be aware that this lib is at the moment a pet project and therefore not thoroughly tested.

Current api docs can be browsed [here](https://terminalstatic.github.io/rust-tidy/tidy/index.html).
